### Telemetry

When the debugger is released to mozilla-central, the Debugger's Scalars and Histograms files are merged into
the M-C [Scalars.yml] and [Histograms.json] files.

For the time being, we can do this manually. We'll likely want to automate this in the next couple weeks.

[Scalars.yml]: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/telemetry/Scalars.yaml
[Histograms.json]: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/telemetry/Histograms.json
